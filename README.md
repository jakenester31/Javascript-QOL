# Javascript-QOL
simple quality of life javascript module.

Reminder:
Always check the changes from version to version, as certain functions may change or be removed/replaced with similar functions.

Also, I doubt there will be good documentation on each update as I'm making these changes while working on larger projects (currently on my magic circle repository).
